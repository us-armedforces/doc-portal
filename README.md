# Gamenights Guide

### Introduction

Gamenights are events that take place outside of any USAF-related games. This may even be outside the ROBLOX platform, on a site like Kahoot. Gamenights may be hosted by Headquarters only. However, there are plans to establish an Events Team specifically dedicated to hosting gamenights.

### Hosting a gamenight

#### **Announcing the event**

Go into the bot-commands channel and create the event using the bot by typing `/events create`. Follow the instructions - select the gamenights channel, then type the name of the event (e.g. Sharkbite Event) when prompted. Unless there is a server limit on the number of players, type `0` when asked for the maximum number of players. Set the start time for 15 minutes from your current time to give players time to join. In the description, link the private server (if relevant) and provide any details of the event. Do not add a role for the gamenight.

#### **During the event**

As the host, you are responsible for making sure that the event goes smoothly. You are expected to make every reasonable accommodation allowing players to join, and the event should last a minimum of 30 minutes. You should announce a winner at the end, and if you wish you may give them an appropriate prize.

#### **Ending the event**

Once you have ended the event, use the `/events delete` command to remove it from the gamenights channel. Remember to log the event in the gamenight-logs channel of the DOAF server.
